 - Comment: Models player learning in a very simple way as the reduction of the standard deviation of the noise of each action an AI bot makes. This is a very interesting approach that may work for very simple taptiming games, but would be unlikely to work for games where the nature of the learning is more complex than that.

This paper was a follow up of the work performed during the GD2 module (2016) and it's been accepted for publication in IEEE CEC 2017.

### Evolving Game Skill-Depth using General Video Game AI Agents

This paper explores these algorithms as a way to efficiently evaluate variations of the Space Battle game in spite of the high computational cost of the evaluations, with the objective of providing versions of the game that show a good skill depth.

## AI-Assisted Game Design (Evolutionary Game Design, Agent Design, and Automatic Game Evaluation)

### An Experiment in Automatic Game Design</b>
 - Julian Togelius and Jurgen Schmidhuber. An Experiment in Automatic Game Design. Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computational     - Link: <a href="http://julian.togelius.com/Togelius2008An.pdf">PDF</a>
  - Comment: One of the first papers on evolving game rules. The idea is to use the learnability of a game as a measure of quality. Measuring learnability is hard, the approach here is to estimate it by measuring how well a neural network can be evolved to play it.

  - Comment: Paper on evolving 2 player board games using itâ€™s own simple game description language. The approach of keeping the game design language (GDL) simple and hiding the complexity in the highlevel language interpreter for the GDL inspired the approach for VGDL. This is in contrast to more general and powerful GDLs which tend to lead to more complex descriptions of the games.
